# Flow Tutorial App

This repository contains an example app designed to demonstrate the concepts of the Flow API in Android using Jetpack Compose.

## Introduction

The Flow API is a powerful tool introduced in Kotlin Coroutines for handling asynchronous data streams more efficiently and concisely. Understanding how to use Flows effectively can significantly enhance your Android app's responsiveness and performance, especially when dealing with reactive data streams.

## Features

- **Flow Basics**: Learn the fundamental concepts of Flows, including how to create, transform, and collect data from them.
- **Flow Operators**: Explore various operators provided by the Flow API for modifying, filtering, and combining data streams.
- **Concurrency**: Understand how Flows handle concurrency and perform operations asynchronously.
- **Error Handling**: Discover best practices for handling errors and exceptions within Flows.
- **Integration with Jetpack Compose**: See how Flows seamlessly integrate with Jetpack Compose to build reactive UIs.

## Getting Started

To run the Flow Example App on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shyakdas/Flow-Example.git
    ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Build and run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

4. Explore the app to learn about different aspects of the Flow API and how they are implemented using Jetpack Compose.
